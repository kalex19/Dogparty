Mod 1: Dog Party Project

This project is a comp of the static webpage: Dog Party. Without the specific dimensions (padding, margin sizes, etc), this comp may not be exact, but it will be close. Media queries were used to make the webpage fit nicely on any screen.

## Motivation

Being able to take an idea or a mockup and create it is an elementary skill for a good developer and a necessary excercise for a novice. By completing this pratice project, I now have more experience in understanding the basics of deign, positioning, HTML, and CSS. Using media queries is a new skill I have picked up with this project as well.
